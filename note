# To use torch
export PATH=$PATH:/home/phanhuy1502/torch/install/bin


# To not use GPU: -gpu -1










# Checkpoint:
.json: in readable format --> still not sure why we need this
.t7: for torch to load/store pretrained model. Apparenly, torch can read this file and create a model (see sample.lua, line 19,20)

# Model used in the project:
model = nn.LanguageModel(opt_clone):type(dtype)
(train.lua, line 97)
--> Checkout nn.LanguageModel
